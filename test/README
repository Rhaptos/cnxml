The files in the descendant subdirectories of the test directory are CNXML files that exemplify valid and invalid constructs.  Files whose names begin with 'm' are valid files, while files whose names begin with 'b' are invalid files.

The 'vtest.sh' file in this directory takes as its only argument a CNXML schema to use for validating the above-mentioned files.  It uses jing to validate each file beginning with either 'b' or 'm' in sub- and subsubdirectories of the working directory, and it writes the output of validation to its stdout.

The 'test.out' file in this directory contains the validation output from a run of this script with the schema of interest.  'test.out' has been committed to subversion, so you can easily discover whether the most recent run of 'vtest.sh' with the schema of interest produces any changes in validation output.  When the schema has been modified so that new errors are found in these files, or so that previous errors have been overlooked, or when the test files have been modified so as to introduce new errors or remove previous ones, the content of 'test.out' will change.  When the changes to 'test.out' are expected, the updated file should be committed to the subversion repository in the same set of commits as the modified schema or test files.  When the changes to 'test.out' are unexpected, the changes provide clues about where the problems lie in the schema or test files.
