  - various small changes to make the XHTML output work better with EIP 
    and be more valid in places

CNXML-0.5 (p19)
  - add translations for lens hover boxes; lenses1 merge

CNXML-0.5 (p18)
  - PDF link wording tweak to match collection printing
  - #3987: support for arbitrary Flash parameters
  - Two "forall" display fixes (#4421, #4423)

CNXML-0.5 (p17)
  - Support for display of collection subtypes

CNXML-0.5 (p16.1)
  - Fix Memorable Cases in IE

CNXML-0.5 (p16)
  - For modules in the Rice U. Press Memorable Cases collection:
    * change the "Click for Solution" and "Hide Solution" labels in
      'exercise' elements to "Click for Diagnosis" and "Hide Diagnosis" respectively;
    * suppress "Problem X" and "Solution X" labels on exercise problems
      and solutions.
    This approach uses a special simple XML file to enumerate the IDs of the
    modules that get this special treatment.  All other modules are rendered as before.

CNXML-0.5 (p15)
  - add l10n entries from lenses0 branch changes to content_render.xsl
  - override l10n.xsl from docbook-xsl
  - nlt0212: spaces around "and" in translated content footer
  - nlt0198: case changes

CNXML-0.5 (p14)
  - March 2007 site redesign (newlook)

CNXML-0.5 (p13)
  - addition of optional roles (currently Editor and Translator)

CNXML-0.5 (p12.1)
  - i18n added for endorsements rollout

CNXML-0.5 (p12)
  - i18n for content

CNXML-0.5 (p11)
  - Added support for LabVIEW 8.20 content

CNXML-0.5 (p10)
  - Provide a link for unrecognized media (inside "<div><object>
    </object></div>" so that the browser can ignore its nested text if
    it somehow recognizes that media as an <object> tag).  Currently
    these media appear to vanish.  The <div> was added so that EIP in IE
    would have something to latch on to, since unrecognized <object>
    tags (though not their children) are apparently omitted in IE.
  - Put class names on certain elements so that EIP can recognize them
    better and so that their templates don't need to be essentially
    duplicated in editInPlace.xsl
  - Make subfigures easier to handle in EIP by moving the class to each
    <td> (instead of one on <table>) and check for IDs of subfigures,
    not their parent figure.

CNXML-0.5 (p9)
  - Made 'id' attribute of 'document' element required instead of optional.
  - Provide a link to the EPS if there are no other media nested inside it

CNXML-0.5 (p8)
 - Fixed codebase URL for LabVIEW 8.0.

CNXML-0.5 (p7)
 - fixed exercises with multiple solutions

CNXML-0.5 (p6)
 - Added implied CNXML namespace declaration to CALS table elements so
   putting the namespace on <table> and children elements does not
   cause the document to be invalid
 - Fixed LabVIEW plugin URL
 - Leave empty paragraphs in place with a comment
 - Don't sort glossary elements

CNXML-0.5 (p5)
 - Removed old content_view.xsl template
 - Moved html2cnxml stylesheet to Zope Product

   in duplicate IDs
 - Moved handling for browsers without mathml support to the mathml2 package

CNXML-0.5 (p1)
