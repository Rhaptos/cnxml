  - #6531: remove some accidental debugging text

CNXML-0.5 (p22)
  - MyCNX lands
    - unibrowser solution/exercise improvements
    - l10n changes for content_render related to new content actions portlet, favorites, recently viewed portlet

CNXML-0.5 (p21.1)
  - #6090: Handle empty "mark" processing instructions

CNXML-0.5 (p21)
  - Major accessibility release:
    - Added translation support for some elements, including hidden ones
    - Better automatic alt tags for images that don't have alt params
    - Changed many elements to make HTML output more semantic
    - Put table footer after tfoot so that screen readers interpret them 
      better, even though that's invalid.
    - Made solution toggler work better for keyboard and screen reader 
  - Pop-ups for terms that link to definitions in in-module glossaries.
  - Added several processing instructions as pre-0.6 hacks
  - Changed several CSS selectors to be more precise or efficient
  - Allowed glossary to have user-supplied ID.
  - #2250: Implemented more of CALS table, including: correct border 
    implementation; support of multiple tgroups; fuller support of 
    colwidth, colsep, rowsep, char, charoff, valign, and align 
    attributes (including from previous unsupported ancestors);

CNXML-0.5 (p16.1)
  - Fix Memorable Cases in IE

CNXML-0.5 (p16)
  - For modules in the Rice U. Press Memorable Cases collection:
    * change the "Click for Solution" and "Hide Solution" labels in
      'exercise' elements to "Click for Diagnosis" and "Hide Diagnosis" respectively;
    * suppress "Problem X" and "Solution X" labels on exercise problems
      and solutions.
    This approach uses a special simple XML file to enumerate the IDs of the
    modules that get this special treatment.  All other modules are rendered as before.

CNXML-0.5 (p15)
  - add l10n entries from lenses0 branch changes to content_render.xsl

  - Added support for LabVIEW 8.20 content

CNXML-0.5 (p10)
  - Provide a link for unrecognized media (inside "<div><object>
    </object></div>" so that the browser can ignore its nested text if
    it somehow recognizes that media as an <object> tag).  Currently
    these media appear to vanish.  The <div> was added so that EIP in IE
    would have something to latch on to, since unrecognized <object>
    tags (though not their children) are apparently omitted in IE.
  - Put class names on certain elements so that EIP can recognize them
    better and so that their templates don't need to be essentially
    duplicated in editInPlace.xsl
  - Make subfigures easier to handle in EIP by moving the class to each
    <td> (instead of one on <table>) and check for IDs of subfigures,
    not their parent figure.

  - Made 'id' attribute of 'document' element required instead of optional.

 - Don't sort glossary elements

CNXML-0.5 (p5)
