  - Added support for LabVIEW 8.20 content
  - Provide a link to the EPS if there are no other media nested inside it
  - Provide a link for unrecognized media (inside "<div><object>
    </object></div>" so that the browser can ignore its nested text if
    it somehow recognizes that media as an <object> tag).  Currently
    these media appear to vanish.  The <div> was added so that EIP in IE
    would have something to latch on to, since unrecognized <object>
    tags (though not their children) are apparently omitted in IE.
  - Put class names on certain elements so that EIP can recognize them
    better and so that their templates don't need to be essentially
    duplicated in editInPlace.xsl
  - Make subfigures easier to handle in EIP by moving the class to each
    <td> (instead of one on <table>) and check for IDs of subfigures,
    not their parent figure.
  - Made 'id' attribute of 'document' element required instead of optional.
